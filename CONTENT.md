## Intro
/** Include past 2 years as reference **/
#### '16
BarCamp Hong Kong is the biggest *unconference* in Hong Kong.

No fixed schedule until the actual event.

Any participle can host a session, in any format, on any topic.

You are the speaker and the audience.

Join us, Expect the Unexpected.

#### '17
We started from a small core and 100+ truely open minded people to land the Un-conference paradigm in Hong Kong. We foster countless interest groups, which in turn make tech and knowledge sharing events vibrant in Hong Kong. We open the stage for all walks of digerati who eager to share instead of sell. We shall bring it on!

This year Barcamp HK will launch as a miniBarcamp in the HKUST Business School Central. Hey! get ready to go Central, go Hong Kong Club? Let's bring openness to one of the most prestigious place in Hong Kong!

* We will enter the building from the "office" side (next to exit J3), no suit is required :)
